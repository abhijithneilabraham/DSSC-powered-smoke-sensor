<h3> Dye-sensitized solar cell

A selection of dye-sensitized solar cells.
A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC, DSC, DYSC or Gr√§tzel cell) is a low-cost solar cell belonging to the group of thin film solar cells. It is based on a semiconductor formed between a photo-sensitized anode and an electrolyte, a photoelectrochemical system.

This was part of a project I have done,and I wanted to use renewable resources which makes use of indoor lighting to power up a sensor for household uses.


The arduino code for the smoke sensor is given here
